*make sure you've installed node in your computer.
*to check, just type "node -v" in your command-line/terminal/command-prompt if it is there then it will show somthing like {v6.3.0}.
*if it shows nothing than go to "nodejs.org" and download the recommended version of node. 
*once its installed please make sure if it is installed correctly by running these two commands seperately in your computer's command-line/terminal/command-prompt "node -v" & "npm -v".
*both commands have to show some version like {v6.3.0} {v0.4.1}
*once you're done with node and npm, you can now go to the project folder and type these two commands seperately.
1. npm install (it will install all the dependencies in a folder named "node-modules")
2. npm start (once this command completes its build process then your project will serve you on localhost:8080)

*open your web browser type in address bar "localhost:8080".
